Welcome to the repository for my master's thesis, **"Exploring Borrower Reliability in Predicting Loan Repayment Ability"**. This project aims to analyze various factors influencing borrowers' reliability and predict their ability to repay loans using data engineering and deep learning techniques - Neural Network.


## Dataset

The Data used for the development of the project is found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data)

## Technologies Used

- **Python**    - For data visualization.
- **PySpark**   - For distributed data Engineering, Processing and Model Development.
- **MySQL**     - To Store Data in the Database.

## Installation and Set Up

- Set up a Pyspark Environment and install the required [libraries](https://github.com/Erevos-IV/Predicting-Loan-Outcome/blob/main/OtherFiles/RequiredLibraries.txt).
- Import the Data files in a MySQL Environment using [LoadDatatoDB.py](https://github.com/Erevos-IV/Predicting-Loan-Outcome/tree/main/LoadDataToDatabase).

## Project Sequence

- Run the [EDA](https://github.com/Erevos-IV/Predicting-Loan-Outcome/blob/main/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/EDA.ipynb) notebook to visualize the data.
- Proceed in Running the [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/Erevos-IV/Predicting-Loan-Outcome/blob/main/FeatureEngineeringAndModel/FeatureEngineering.ipynb) notebook to perform changes in the data and develop the model. Note that this will take some time as this is the core code.
